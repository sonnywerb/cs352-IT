The biggest challenge in developing Project 0 is related to using the Python socket library: we had to navigate through several possibly conflicting sources in the textbook and Internet searches. In particular, the worst offenders were socket.accept() and socket.sendall(). Most of the time was spent not coding but sorting through all of the information we found and figuring out which one works for this project. In addition, I think learning how to use a debugger for Python will be handy for later.
