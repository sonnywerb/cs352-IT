**Project Overview**
Used Python 2.7--when running the program, we did not import Python 3.
Server socket that sends a UDP message to Google DNS server and ask for the IP address without usage of gethostbyname or any similar functions and returns it back to the client.

**Known issues**
Certain websites prohibit a user from directly connecting via an IP address.

**Development**
The main challenge with this project development was navigating through the information in regards to how and when to use Python strings, structs, and etc. James Routley's blog on handwriting DNS messages was espeially useful. (Link:https://routley.io/posts/hand-writing-dns-messages/)
