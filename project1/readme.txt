**Project Overview**
We used Python 2.7--when running the program, we did not import Python 3.

**Known issues**
Certain websites prohibit a user from directly connecting via an IP address.

**Development**
The main challenge with this project development was navigating through the information in regards to how and when to use Python strings, structs, and etc. James Routley's blog on handwriting DNS messages was espeially useful. (Link:https://routley.io/posts/hand-writing-dns-messages/)
