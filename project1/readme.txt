We used Python 2.7--when running the program, we did not import Python 3

**Known issues**
Certain websites prohibit a user from directly connecting via an IP address. This is something that cannot be addressed on our end.


**Development**
Working on and off, this project took around a week to complete. The main project-related (not caused by "outside" factors such as the abysmal quality of the professor's lectures forcing us to self-study the entire course) challenge that was solvable was navigating through differing information about Python strings, structs, etc--how to use, when to use, etc. I believe that Routley's blog post on handwriting DNS messages was invaluable, but I think that this can be improved upon by explaining what each of them means, or if there's any constraints--for example, what is Type A.
